# Personal Blog

This is a blog that I want to make in my spare time! I'll likely start properly hosting it once I finish up with my portfolio project from [The Odin Project][TOP]. I'm using [Astro][Astro] primarily because organizing content is dead simple (especially since the [2.0 release][Astro 2.0])

Since I'm still a student, I'll use this blog to share my thoughts on the things that I learn and whatnot, and having a blog will make it much easier to keep track of progress. I'll keep my markdown files locally stored so anybody who wants to use this repo as a template can :)

Blog posts will be stored in `src/content/blog` from the project root

I'll add some screenshots here once I'm sufficiently satistfied with the styling!
